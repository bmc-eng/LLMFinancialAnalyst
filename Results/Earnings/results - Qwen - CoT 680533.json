Use the following income statement, balance sheet and cash flow to make a decision on if earnings will increase over the next financial period. Think step-by-step through the financial statement analysis workflow. Your report should have the following sections: 1. Analysis of current profitability, liquidity, solvency and efficiency ratios; 2. time-series analysis across the ratios; 3. Analysis of financial performance; 4. Stock Price analysis; 5. Decision Analysis looking at the positive and negative factors as well as the weighting in the final decision; 6. Final Decision. Make your decision only on the datasets. Explain your reasons in less than 250 words. Indicate the magnitude of the increase or decrease. Provide a confidence score for how confident you are of the decision. If you are not confident then lower the confidence score. You must answer in a JSON format with a 'earnings', 'magnitude', 'confidence' and 'reason'.
